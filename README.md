# README

This has been based off of emacs\_osx\_dk from the main qmk repo. However, I've
taken some of the ideas for the thumbs from dvorak\_emacs and tweaked it a bit
based on the keycaps I have.

## Instructions

1. Clone the main qmk repo
2. Clone this to $QMK/keyboards/ergodox/layouts/belak
3. Run `make ergodox-belak-teensy

## Changelog
